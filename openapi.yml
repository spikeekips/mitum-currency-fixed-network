        the state of account if the *FactSign* of operation have the enough signs of *AccountKeys*.

        - Multiple *AccountKey* can be defined and at least, one *AccountKey* should be defined.

        - The sum of *weight* of *AccountKey*s should be over *threshold*.


        For example, if there are 3 *AccountKey* and *threshold* is `60`,

        - `key0`:
          * publickey: `key0-pub`
          * weight: `30`

        - `key1`:
          * publickey: `key1-pub`
          * weight: `30`

        - `key2`:
          * publickey: `key2-pub`
          * weight: `30`

        The *FactSign* of the operation consists with signs of `key0` and `key1`. In this
        *FactSign*, the sum of *weight* is `60` and is same or over *threshold*, `sum=60 >=
        threshold=60`, so this *FactSign* authorizes the operation.
